# Resource Component (Unreal Engine Plugin)
The component can be used as health, mana, stamina, or any other reusable resource. The purpose of this plugin is to provide GAS-like resources without implementing GAS. Please note that this is not as dynamic as GAS, but does provide more functionality than a float that you add/subtract values from.

Includes a modifiable Health component and a ready-made Health component with UI elements.

For information on how to use the plugin please see the [wiki](https://github.com/Cutter-H/ResourceComponentPlugin.wiki.git).
